Echo
====

*Echo* is a Windows Phone 7 App that aims to enable the deaf and hard of hearing to use the telephone. It does this by connecting to a custom server (soon to be released under a GPL license) that transcribes the content of calls.

In Addition to the telephone part, *Echo* includes a pronunciation trainer that gives the user the feedback his or her ears cannot and enables them to work towards a perfectly natural pronunciation.
